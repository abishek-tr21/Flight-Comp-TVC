Working Principle :

The flight computer stabilizes and controls the rocket’s trajectory using **Thrust Vector Control (TVC)**. The **MPU6050 IMU** detects angular deviations, and the **SG90 servo motors** tilt the nozzle to correct the rocket’s path. The **BMP280** measures altitude, while the **LoRa module** transmits real-time telemetry data. The **LiPo battery** provides power through a **step-down voltage regulator** to match the components’ voltage requirements.
